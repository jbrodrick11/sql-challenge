# sql-challenge
Repo for Module 9 Challenge

Moving files from local machine after working on them. Includes -

-All Starter .csv Files
-ERD created using QuickDBD
-3x .sql files (One for Table Schema, One for Analysis Queries, and One with both in the same file)

Added comments to sql files to ensure steps are clearly defined.

-Import that when Table Schemata.sql file is ran, on the dept_emp table the id column is removed from the import window when. trying to import the .csv file to the table. This is commented out in the .sql file accordingly to show that it needs to be altered to accomodate for the id pk-column put into the table.

Uploaded all required documents to git-repository.
